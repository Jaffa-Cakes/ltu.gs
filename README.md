# The (LTUGS) La Trobe University Gaming Society's Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project and is built into a static set of files so that a `node.js` server is not required when live.

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Production

To build the production version of the website:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built version will be stored in the `out` directory.

## Contribution

Feel free to contrinue to the repository and help out the society if there is anything you'd like to add!

Note that this project is intended to be a static website without any dynamic content due to our simple requirements.
